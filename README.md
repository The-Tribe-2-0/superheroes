## Project Description
The Superhero Tracker API is a Ruby on Rails-based backend system designed to efficiently manage and track superheroes along with their superpowers. It enables the listing, retrieval, and association of heroes and powers, supporting a many-to-many relationship between them with an additional 'strength' attribute. The API provides flexible and intuitive endpoints, offering features like retrieving all heroes or powers, getting details of a specific hero or power, updating a power's description, and creating a new association between a hero and a power. This API serves as a fundamental backend system for applications related to superhero fan websites, comic book stores, or superhero-themed games.
